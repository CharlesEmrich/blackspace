## Description
blackspace is not just any old text editor, blackspace is the gateway to character art. blackspace is a text editor that outputs characters other than what the user inputted. The outputs are glyphs made of characters adjacent to those entered. Curious? --- let's make some art!

## Specs

| Description | input | output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Letter is entered into text box returns adjacent letters layered on top of each other.  | a | b overlapping z |
| Capitalized Letter returns adjacent letters capitalized. | A | B overlapping Z |
| Number entered returns adjacent numbers overlapping | 1 | 0 overlapping 2|
| Special character is entered returns that special character | " " | " " |
| Up and down arrows (+ alt) select the amount of characters overlapping. | up arrow clicked once, A is inputted. | B,C,Y,Z overlap |
| Output can return every letter or number that is not the one entered| A | letters B-Z overlapping|
| When keys are pressed the waves thicken and jaggify.| G | **~ ~ ~**|
| When specific keys are entered the waves change colors.| D | ~ ~ ~ (blue) |
| Left and right arrows (+ alt) change fonts | > | Font change |



## MVP

Replace inputted character with adjacent cipher that is overlapped by user defined drop down menu (over lapping: 1 to 12). The minimum styling for the UI is black space, monospace font, centered text and logo.
